Origin Trace System

## Overview

The *Origin Trace System* is a backend solution designed to ensure product quality verification, intelligent substitution, and blockchain-based warranty creation. The system allows users to submit product specifications, checks for available inventory or the closest AI-matched product, and returns the results along with a secure smart contract on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain.

## 🔧 Features

- *User Specification Input:*  
  Users can input detailed product specifications via a frontend interface.

- *Operations Department Integration:*  
  The system communicates with the Operations department via API to validate the request and log product data.

- *AI-Based Substitution:*  
  If the requested product is unavailable, an AI model recommends the closest alternative based on the user's specifications.

- *Result Registration & Response:*  
  The selected or recommended product is registered in the backend and sent back to the frontend for user confirmation.

- *Blockchain Warranty Creation:*  
  A smart contract is created on the ICP blockchain to certify the product's origin and provide warranty coverage.

🔗 Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js / Vue.js (customizable)

Backend: Node.js / Express (or your backend framework)

AI Model: Python-based recommendation engine (can be ML/DL)

Blockchain: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB / Firebase (depending on deployment)

📡 API Flow
POST /submit-product-specs

Payload: Product requirements from the user.

GET /check-inventory

Internal API checks available stock.

POST /ai/match-product

If not found, forwards data to AI engine.

POST /blockchain/create-contract

Registers product on ICP blockchain with warranty.

GET /product-result

Returns final matched product and contract info.

✅ Example Use Case
A user submits a specification for a medical device.

The system checks the backend inventory.

No exact match is found.

AI engine recommends the closest match.

The product is registered and a warranty contract is issued on ICP.

The result is sent back to the user via frontend.

🔐 Smart Contract (ICP)
Each matched product is registered with:

Product UUID

Manufacturer Details

Warranty Period

Origin Signature

All contract data is stored immutably on the Internet Computer blockchain to ensure traceability and trust.
